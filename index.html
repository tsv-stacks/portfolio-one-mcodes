        <p>After spending many years modding games and old consoles, I became interested in learning how these programs and mod files were made. This led me to independently developed (indie) games and sparked my interest in coding. I began my learning journey with FreeCodeCamp and the Odin Project before deciding coding was something I was genuinely interested in and enjoyed the creativity (as well as the challenges!) to pursue a career in.</p>
